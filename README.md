# .Net Wrapper for Saitek/Logitech Flight Instrument Panel and DirectOutput API.

This is a work in progrss. I have a Saitek (now owned by Logitech) Flight Instrument Panel and wanted to start displaying custom content on it. I'm figuring out the DirectOutput API to do just that. 

Once completed, you'll find information on it over at [my blog](https://blog.j2i.net)
